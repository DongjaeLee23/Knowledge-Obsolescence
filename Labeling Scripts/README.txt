How To Use:
1.) Take the raw data and use the tweetparser.py script which will parse the full text and add a labeling field beside it.
2.) Take this parsed data and use the englishfilter.py to go through the data and filter text that uses languages that are not english.
3.) Perform labeling of at least label 500 entries of data.
4.) Once the data is labeled, use the script labelfilter.py which will produce a csv of only the text entries that was labeled as fake news.
5.) Open the csv file and delete the label column to have only the required text.

Enjoy :)
