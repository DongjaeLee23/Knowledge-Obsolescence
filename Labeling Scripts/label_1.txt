This list is updated regularly as case investigations proceed.

There are more than 500 COVID-19 testing locations across NSW, many of which are open seven days a week. To find your nearest clinic visit COVID-19 clinics or contact your GP.
@PressSec Yep, this is a pandemic of the UNVACCINATED, isn’t it?

If you haven’t received a COVID-19 vaccination yet, please don’t delay. Even if you have had COVID-19 and recovered, you should get vaccinated.

In this phase of the pandemic, the onus is on every one of us to keep each other safe, especially our most vulnerable.
If you are directed to get tested for COVID 19 or self-isolate at any time, you must follow the rules whether or not the venue or exposure setting is listed on the NSW Health website.

Inhaling steam or suob has been used to relieve some symptoms of COVID-19 but it has no recorded evidence of being beneficial against the infection.
Do not be misled; always remember the health protocols and get vaccinated for extra protection.

It can't be the vaccination based on what we're seeing out of UK, Israel, Singapore etc.

California has a 4-1 patient ratio. Meaning, 1 nurse to 4 patients. The reason why so many people died in NY during COVID outbreak? They have a 15-1 patient ratio. Patients would of run out of oxygen, and nurses wouldn't find out because they have so many patients.
@Cernovich I am an American and a nurse and I live in Italy. I admit, I was sucked into the hysteria. It was very easy here. But during the second month of lockdown, I began to see the shenanigans. For me, the vax was always a no go. I remember H1N1 and how terrified I was after that vax.
